Learning Outcomes

1. Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals AI Overview
   Unit2: Generative AI and agents
   - Define generative AI and list at least three types of content it can produce.
   - What role does a language model play in generative AI solutions?
   - How do users interact with generative AI models?
   - Explain the importance of semantic relationships in generative AI models.
   - Distinguish between large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs). Provide one advantage of each.
   - Describe two common use cases for generative AI.

   Unit 3: Text and natural language
   - What is natural language processing (NLP)?
   - Give one reason why simpler NLP models might still be used instead of generative AI models.
   - Explain the difference between text classification, key-term extraction, and summarization in NLP.
   - Compare NLP-based text analysis tasks with generative AI tasks in terms of complexity and use cases.
   - A company wants to analyse thousands of customer reviews to determine overall satisfaction and identify frequently mentioned products. Which NLP techniques would be appropriate and why?
   - A business wants to implement a chatbot that answers repetitive questions like business hours, returns policies, and support steps. Should they use generative AI or traditional NLP, and why?

   Unit 4: Speech
   - What is speech recognition in the context of AI?
   - What is speech synthesis in the context of AI?
   - Explain how speech recognition and speech synthesis enable speech-based interaction between users and AI systems.
   - Compare speech recognition and speech synthesis in terms of direction of information flow and purpose.
   - A company wants to automatically transcribe meeting audio and generate accurate textual notes. Which AI speech capability is most relevant and why?
   - A navigation assistant needs to announce driving directions aloud to users while they are driving. Which AI speech capability should be used and why?
   
   Unit 5: Computer vision
   - What is computer vision?
   - What is the goal of image classification in computer vision?
   - Explain the difference between object detection and semantic segmentation.
   - Compare image classification, object detection, and multi-modal models in terms of functionality and output.
   - A retail store wants to automatically monitor inventory on shelves by detecting when products are running low. Which computer vision technique would be most appropriate and why?
   - A social media platform wants to automatically generate descriptive captions for user-uploaded images. Which type of computer vision model would be required and why?

   Unit 6: Information extraction
   - What type of data do information extraction solutions commonly target?
   - What is the role of optical character recognition (OCR) in document analysis?
   - Explain how OCR and analytical models work together to extract structured information from documents.
   - Compare traditional text-based extraction models with newer multimodal extraction models.
   - An organization needs to digitize thousands of old census forms stored on paper for long-term archiving. Which AI capability would be useful and why?
   - A business wants to automatically identify key follow-up actions from recorded meeting discussions. Which AI approach should be used and why?
